cart page

We can write a list of the requirements related to our cart:

01. Must provide a method to add, update, and remove the item.

02. Must store the item list across the session; if the user closes the browser, when he returns to the website, the cart should be there!

03. Must provide a method to be used to calculate the total amount and item number.
